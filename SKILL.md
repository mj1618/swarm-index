# Using swarm-index (for agents)

Scan a project to build an index, then look up files instantly.

```bash
# First-time setup: scan the project
swarm-index scan .

# Look up files by name or path
swarm-index lookup "handleAuth"

# Limit results
swarm-index lookup "test" --max 5

# Point lookup at a specific project root
swarm-index lookup "config" --root ~/code/my-project
```

Use `--json` on any command for structured output. Use `--max N` to limit `lookup` results (default 20).
