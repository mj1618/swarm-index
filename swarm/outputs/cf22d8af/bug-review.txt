No bugs found. The search command implementation is clean and correct:
- search.go: Proper binary detection, correct 1-based line numbering, result limit enforcement
- main.go: Search case follows existing patterns, handles JSON/text output correctly
- Tests: Comprehensive coverage, all passing
- Docs: README.md and SKILL.md properly updated
