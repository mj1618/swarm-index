# Refactor Review — No Changes Needed

Reviewed all unstaged changes. The diff contains:
- Binary rebuild of `swarm-index`
- Auto-generated `index.json` and `meta.json` from a re-scan (added CLAUDE.md entry)
- Config tweaks in `swarm.yaml` (prompt wording, iteration count)

No application code was modified, so no refactoring opportunities apply.
